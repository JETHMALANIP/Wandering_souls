                                Leela story begins with the opening of The Leela Mumbai in 1986, when its founder Late
                                Captain C P Krishnan Nair, at the age of 65 years started to build the The Leela
                                Palaces, Hotels and Resorts.
                                The success of The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts surprised everyone but Captain C P
                                Krishnan Nair himself. No stranger to humble beginnings, and boundless ambition, Captain
                                Nair was a man known for transforming his own circumstances, and those of the people who
                                worked with him. His long and diverse career saw him move from an ordinary citizen to a
                                respected army officer, and from a successful textile exporter to one of the leading
                                hoteliers of the world.
                                Today, The Leela is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, a leading global alternative
                                asset manager with over $625 billion in assets under management, as well as a 120-year
                                history of owning and operating high quality assets.
                                Under the Brookfield ownership, The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts is a pure play
                                luxury brand, well poised to embrace the next new phase in its growth trajectory.
